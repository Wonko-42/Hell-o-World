Hi, Sam here!

Let me introduce myself: I'm a white nineteenth year old boy from an italian middle class family and I've always been kind of a dreamer and loony. I'm a beginner programmer and a student at Federico II Computer Engineering University. I started programming 2 years ago and in these  years I learnt something about python, java and C++.
